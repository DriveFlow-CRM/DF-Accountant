# Fonts Directory

This directory is used to store fonts required for PDF generation with proper Romanian character support.

## Required Fonts

The following fonts are automatically downloaded by the `download_fonts.py` script:

- DejaVuSans.ttf - Regular font for body text
- DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf - Bold font for headers and emphasis

## Manual Installation

If the automatic download script fails, you can manually download the DejaVu fonts from:
https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/

After downloading, extract the TTF files and place them in this directory.
